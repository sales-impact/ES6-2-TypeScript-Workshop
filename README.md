# From ES6 to TypeScript
## Hands on workshop

## Who is this workshop for
Developers who want to explore the TypeScript way.

## Prerequisites
You should be familiar with JavaScript and have a basic GIT knowledge.

## What this workshop is not
It is not a deep dive course. The goal is to demonstrate TypeScript on a real use case.

## What are we going to do
We are going to rush over the theory and focus on a pet project. You will code along and try first hand on all the topics.
